## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

Here‚Äôs your list formatted for the README:

## ‚öôÔ∏è NPM Modules Used
  
- `"@chakra-ui/react": "^2.10.7"` - A modular and accessible UI library to build modern web applications.  
- `"@emotion/styled": "^11.11.0"` - To write CSS-in-JS styles with a styled-components-like syntax.  
- `"@monaco-editor/react": "^4.7.0"` - To integrate the Monaco editor (VS Code‚Äôs editor) into React applications.  
- `"@types/react-window": "^1.8.8"` - To render large data efficiently.  
- `"framer-motion": "^10.16.5"` - Enables smooth animations and transitions in React components.  
- `"react": "^18.2.0"` - The core React library for building UI components.  
- `"react-dom": "^18.2.0"` - To interact with React's virtual DOM  
- `"react-router-dom": "^7.4.0"` - To client-side routing in React applications.  
- `"zustand": "^4.4.6"` - A lightweight state management library for managing application state efficiently.  


## ‚úÖ Pros and Cons of Proposed Solution

### Pros
- Streamlined and user-friendly interface
- Clean architecture with a fallback mechanism
- Clear separation of concerns between data and UI layers
- Full TypeScript integration reduces runtime errors

### Cons
- Monolithic structure; could benefit from microservices along with backend
- Large datasets handling requires virtual scrolling
- Potential for improvements with caching and additional fallback mechanisms



## üìä Page Load Time & Performance Metrics

![Performance Metrics](assets/performance-metrics.png)

Our application achieves excellent performance metrics as measured by Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights (https://pagespeed.web.dev/):

- **Initial Page Load**: 1.2s
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: 0.8s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: 1.7s
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: 1.9s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: 0.05

### Measurement Methodology
Performance metrics were collected using:
- Google Lighthouse audits in Chrome DevTools
- PageSpeed Insights (https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
- Chrome Performance profiling tools
- Real user monitoring across different device profiles

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

Several key optimizations are implemented to enhance application performance:

### Asset Optimization
- Converted all icons to SVG format for faster rendering and reduced file size
- Removed unused CSS through tree-shaking and purging techniques
- Minified all static assets during build process

### Data Handling
- Implemented `react-window` for virtualized rendering of large datasets
- Applied data compression techniques for all json data

### UI/UX Improvements
- Eliminated large layout shifts (CLS optimization) through proper placeholder usage
- Implemented loaders for asynchronous content
- Deferred non-critical JavaScript execution
- Applied code-splitting based on route boundaries

### Build Optimizations
- Configured Webpack for optimal chunking and tree-shaking
- Applied brotli compression for deployments


### Performance Optimizations
1. **Code Splitting**
   - Lazy loading of Monaco Editor

2. **Asset Optimization**
   - Gzip compression enabled
   - Image optimization using Vite plugins

3. **State Management**
   - Efficient state updates using Zustand
   - Memoized selectors for preventing unnecessary rerenders

4. **Large Dataset Handling**
   - Virtualized scrolling for large result sets

## üìù Demo Queries

Sample queries to explore different aspects of the database:

### üõçÔ∏è Products Queries
```sql
-- View all products
SELECT * FROM products;

-- Products with categories
SELECT p.ProductName, c.CategoryName
FROM products p
JOIN categories c ON p.CategoryID = c.CategoryID;

-- Top expensive products
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice
FROM products
ORDER BY UnitPrice DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### üë• Customer Analysis
```sql
-- Customer distribution by country
SELECT Country, COUNT(*) as CustomerCount
FROM customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY CustomerCount DESC;

-- Top performing customers
SELECT 
  c.CustomerID, 
  c.CompanyName, 
  SUM(od.Quantity * od.UnitPrice) as TotalPurchases
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN order_details od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID
ORDER BY TotalPurchases DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### üì¶ Order Insights
```sql
-- Recent orders tracking
SELECT * FROM orders
ORDER BY OrderDate DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Employee order performance
SELECT 
  e.FirstName, 
  e.LastName, 
  COUNT(o.OrderID) as OrderCount
FROM employees e
JOIN orders o ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
GROUP BY e.EmployeeID
ORDER BY OrderCount DESC;
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configure your environment variables in `.env`:

```env
VITE_API_ENDPOINT=your_api_endpoint //future considerations
